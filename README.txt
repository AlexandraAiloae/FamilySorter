The changes I made can be found in the folders:
    -Controllers
    -DTOs
    -Services

I also added some lines of code in Program.cs in order to register services with the ASP.NET Core dependency injection container

I have added an Input.txt file to this archive containing the input you gave me. 
The program reads this file and creates an Output.txt file in which the result is written. If the Output file exists it overwrites the content.
